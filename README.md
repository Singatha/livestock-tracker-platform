## About

Flockwise helps sheep and goat farmers manage livestock records from one responsive workspace. It combines individual animal histories with farm-level health, reproduction, growth, medicine, nutrition, task, and reporting workflows. The web interface is installable as a Progressive Web App (PWA).

## Features

- Farms, team memberships, role-based access, flocks, and animal profiles
- Health observations, treatments, attachments, and complete animal timelines
- Breeding records, expected birth dates, and birth outcomes
- Weight history, average daily gain, and growth reporting
- Medicine products, batches, treatment courses, doses, and withdrawal periods
- Feed products, diet plans, husbandry tasks, reminders, and notifications
- CSV reports and imports, audit history, and private farm documents
- Signup, session authentication, password recovery, and installable PWA support

## Architecture

| Layer | Technology | Responsibility |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Web | Nuxt 4, Vue 3, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS | Responsive user interface and PWA |
| API | Django 5.2, Django REST Framework | Authentication, permissions, and business workflows |
| Data | PostgreSQL 17 | Relational livestock and farm records |
| Jobs | Celery, Redis | Scheduled reminders and background processing |
| Local runtime | Docker Compose | Reproducible development environment |

The backend is a modular monolith. Domain modules live in `backend/apps/`, while the frontend is organised under `frontend/app/`. Architecture decisions and MVP boundaries are documented in `docs/adr/` and `docs/mvp.md`.

## Quick Start

### Requirements

- Docker Desktop with Docker Compose
- Git

### Run locally

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd livestock-tracker-platform
cp .env.example .env
docker compose up --build
```

Open the following services:

- Web application: http://localhost:3000
- API: http://localhost:8000/api/v1/
- OpenAPI documentation: http://localhost:8000/api/docs/
- Django Admin: http://localhost:8000/admin/

Create an account from `/signup`, or create an admin user with:

```bash
docker compose exec api python manage.py createsuperuser
```

To load a dashboard-ready demonstration farm, run:

```bash
docker compose exec api python manage.py seed_demo_data
```

Sign in with `demo` / `demo-password`. The command is safe to rerun and accepts
`--username` and `--password` when different local credentials are preferred.

Stop the stack with `docker compose down`. Avoid `docker compose down -v` unless you intentionally want to delete local database and attachment volumes.

## Configuration

Copy `.env.example` and replace the development defaults. Important settings include:

| Variable | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `DJANGO_SECRET_KEY` | Cryptographic signing key; use a long random value |
| `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` | Local or deployed database password |
| `DJANGO_ALLOWED_HOSTS` | Hosts accepted by Django |
| `DJANGO_CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | Trusted frontend origins |
| `NUXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE` | Browser-visible API base URL |
| `DJANGO_ATTACHMENT_MAX_SIZE` | Maximum upload size in bytes |
| `DJANGO_EMAIL_*` | SMTP delivery for invitations and password recovery |
| `FRONTEND_BASE_URL` | Base URL used in emailed links |

The console email backend is suitable for local development; reset and invitation links appear in API or worker logs. Never commit `.env` or production credentials.

## Testing and Quality

Run checks through the active Compose stack:

```bash
docker compose exec api ruff check .
docker compose exec api ruff format --check .
docker compose exec api pytest -q
docker compose exec web npm run typecheck
docker compose exec web npm run build
```

Backend tests cover permissions, farm isolation, validation, and API workflows. New domain behavior should include focused `test_*.py` coverage.

## PWA Preview

Service workers are disabled during development to prevent stale caches. Test the production PWA locally with:

```bash
docker compose stop web
docker compose run --rm web npm run build
docker compose run --rm --service-ports web npm run preview -- --host=0.0.0.0
```

Open http://localhost:3000 and use the account menu or browser installation control. Farm API responses and private media are deliberately excluded from offline caching.

## Roadmap

- Production deployment, CI/CD, backups, monitoring, and transactional email
- Optional OAuth providers
- Location tracking when compatible livestock tags are available
- Native mobile applications if PWA usage demonstrates a clear need
- Livestock knowledge assistant after the core operational product is mature

## Contributing

Read [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for repository structure, coding standards, testing expectations, and pull-request guidance. Keep changes focused, include tests for new backend behavior, and include screenshots for visible UI changes.

## Security

Do not report sensitive vulnerabilities through a public issue. Share them privately with the repository owner. This project is still preparing for production deployment and should not be exposed publicly without secure settings, HTTPS, backups, and reviewed infrastructure.
